# kudu-python is needed but cannot be listed as usual. The Kudu client lib (.so file)
# is needed for compilation/installation but the client lib is provided by the toolchain.
# The virtualenv may need to be functional even if the toolchain isn't present. The
# bootstap_virtualenv.py script special-cases kudu-python, the line below is actually
# functional and determines the expected kudu-python version. The version must be listed
# in the format below including # and spacing. Keep this formatting! The kudu-python
# version in download_requirements must be kept in sync with this version.
