---- QUERY
# tpch_avro does not have stats computed, so if we set disable_unsafe_spills we should
# not spill to disk.
set disable_unsafe_spills=true;
set buffer_pool_limit=40m;
select distinct *
from tpch_avro.orders
---- CATCH
Could not free memory by spilling to disk: spilling was disabled by planner. Re-enable spilling by setting the query option DISABLE_UNSAFE_SPILLS=false
