/// | IMPLEMENTATION NOTES   |
/// +========================+
///
/// Lock Ordering
/// =============
/// The lock acquisition order is:
/// 1. Client::lock_
/// 2. BufferPool::clean_pages_lock_
/// 3. Page::lock
///
/// If a reference to a Page is acquired through a page list, the Page* reference only
/// remains valid so long as list's lock is held.
///
/// Page States
/// ===========
/// Each Page object is owned by at most one InternalList<Page> at any given point.
/// Each page is either pinned or unpinned. Unpinned has a number of sub-states, which
/// is determined by which list in Client/BufferPool contains the page.
/// * Pinned: Always in this state when 'pin_count' > 0. The page is in
///     Client::pinned_pages_.
/// * Unpinned - Dirty: When no write has been started for an unpinned page. The page is
///     in Client::dirty_unpinned_pages_.
/// * Unpinned - Write in flight: When the write has been started but not completed for
///     a dirty unpinned page. The page is in Client::write_in_flight_pages_. For
///     accounting purposes this is considered a dirty page.
/// * Unpinned - Clean: When the write has completed but the page was not evicted. The
///     page is in BufferPool::clean_pages_.
/// * Unpinned - Evicted: After a clean page's buffer has been reclaimed. The page is
///     not in any list.
///
/// Page Eviction Policy
/// ====================
/// The page eviction policy is designed so that clients that run only in-memory (i.e.
/// don't unpin pages) never block on I/O. To achieve this, we must be able to
/// fulfil reservations by either allocating buffers or evicting clean pages. Assuming
/// reservations are not overcommitted (they shouldn't be), this global invariant can be
/// maintained by enforcing a local invariant for every client:
///
///   unused reservation >= dirty unpinned pages
///
/// The local invariant is maintained by writing pages to disk as the first step of any
/// operation that uses reservation. I.e. the R.H.S. of the invariant must be decreased
/// before the L.H.S. can be decreased. These operations block waiting for enough writes
/// to complete to satisfy the invariant.
/// TODO: this invariant can be broken if a client calls DecreaseReservation() on the
/// ReservationTracker. We should refactor so that DecreaseReservation() goes through
/// the client before closing IMPALA-3202.
