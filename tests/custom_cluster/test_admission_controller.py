  end its query. The query thread can end its query by fetching to the end, cancelling
  itself, closing itself, or waiting for the query timeout to take effect. Depending
  on the test parameters a varying number of queries will be admitted, queued, and
  rejected. After the queries are admitted, the main thread will request each admitted
  query thread to end its query and allow queued queries to be admitted.

  The test tracks the state of the admission controller using the metrics from each
  impalad to do the following:
  (1) After submitting all queries, the change in metrics for the number of admitted,
      queued, and rejected requests should sum to the number of queries and that the
      values are reasonable given the test parameters.
  (2) While there are running queries:
      * Request the currently running queries to end and wait for the queries to end.
        Verify the metric for the number of completed queries. The threads that
        submitted those queries will keep their connections open until the entire test
        completes. This verifies that admission control is tied to the end of the query
        and does not depend on closing the connection.
      * Check that queued requests are then dequeued and verify using the metric for the
        number of dequeued requests. The threads that were waiting to submit the query
        should then insert themselves into a list of currently running queries and then
        wait for a notification from the main thread.
  (3) After all queries have completed, check that the final number of admitted,
      queued, and rejected requests are reasonable given the test parameters. When
      submitting to a single impalad, we know exactly what the values should be,
      otherwise we just check that they are within reasonable bounds.
